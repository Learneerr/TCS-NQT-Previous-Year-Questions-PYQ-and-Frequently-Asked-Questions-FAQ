# TCS NQT Previous Year Questions(PYQ) and Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ)

Iâ€™m sharing the exact coding questions I practiced for the **TCS NQT 2024**. These are the ones that helped me prepare and crack the test â€” so I thought it might help others too.

## âœ… How to Access the TCS NQT Sheet

If you want to view the same problems I solved and try them yourself:

### ðŸ‘‰ Steps:
1. Visit [**CodeVault**](https://codeevault.netlify.app)
2. Sign up with your email.
3. Click **"Recieve"** in the header near logout.
4. Enter this share code: **TCS123**

Once you import it, all problems will be added to your account â€” and you can start solving or editing them however you want.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: To view the question, click on the **"View Question / Notes"** button near the **Run** button in the editor.

## ðŸ’¬ Why Iâ€™m Sharing This

I found CodeVault really helpful during my prep â€” better than using random files or notepad.  
It kept everything in one place and made me practice more seriously.

So instead of just uploading code here, Iâ€™ve added all questions inside CodeVault and shared the code above so you can use it too.

Hope this helps someone else in their prep journey! ðŸ˜Š
